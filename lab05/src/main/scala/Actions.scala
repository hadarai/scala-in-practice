  //SIP this one cant be done ony with Stackable Modifications. Could be like (very generic solution):
  // val actionF: Pluginable = new PluginRepeated(new Pluginable with Rotating, 5)
  // class PluginRepeated(p: Pluginable, repeat: Int) extends Pluginable {
  // //...require for repeat
  //   override def plugin(s: String): String = repeatPlugin(s, repeat)
  //   private def repeatPlugin(s: String, i: Int): String = {
  //     if (i <= 0) s else repeatPlugin(p.plugin(s), i-1)
  //   }
  // }

  
  val actionG: Pluginable = new Pluginable with Doubling with Shortening with NoSpacing with SingleSpacing
  //plugin applying plugins with order: actionA => actionB
  //SIP Its not a good approach. If in the future someone will change the actionA or actionA, will need to remember to
  //change also actionG. Check DRY principle (google 'don't repeat yourself').
